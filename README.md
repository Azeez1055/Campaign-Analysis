# Combined Email and Social Media Campaign Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes data from both email and social media marketing campaigns to understand overall effectiveness, channel-specific performance, and potential synergies. The analysis aims to identify key factors driving conversions and inform future campaign strategies. The analysis is performed using Python, SQL-like queries, and Power BI.

## Files

*   `campaign_analysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete analysis, including:
    *   Data loading and cleaning
    *   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations (Python)
    *   SQL-like queries for data exploration
    *   Calculations of key performance indicators (KPIs)
    *   Segmentation analysis
*   `combined_campaign_data.csv`: This file contains the synthetic campaign data used in the analysis. It can be generated by running the data generation cell in the `campaign_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
*   `Campaign Analysis Power BI Visualizations.pbix` (Optional): This Power BI Desktop file contains interactive visualizations of the campaign data (to be created later).

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

*   **Python 3.6 or higher:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```
*   **Required Python Libraries:** Install the following libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
    *   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
    *   `matplotlib`: For creating basic visualizations.
    *   `seaborn`: For creating more advanced statistical visualizations.
*   **A Tool for Querying Flat Files (Required for SQL Section):** You will need a tool that allows you to execute SQL-like queries against flat files (CSV). Examples include:
    *   **Apache Drill:** A distributed SQL query engine for Hadoop and other data sources.
    *   **Apache Presto:** A distributed SQL query engine designed for fast analytic queries against data of all sizes.
    *   **Pandas with SQL Integration (Python):** You can use the `pandasql` library or the `sqlite3` library with Pandas to execute SQL queries against a Pandas DataFrame.
*   **Power BI Desktop (Optional):** If you plan to create the Power BI visualizations, you will need to install Power BI Desktop.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```

2.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook from the command line:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open the `campaign_analysis.ipynb` file in your web browser.

3.  **Run the Notebook Cells:** Execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially. The notebook is designed to be run from top to bottom.

## Analysis

This project combines and connects data from the campaign, it's also very important to run this.

### Python Visualization (EDA)

You have to find the proper columns so that you can run this code.

### SQL Query for Data
You can use this set of code that may or may not show everything properly.

### Power BI (Optional)
If you decide to create a Power BI visualization file, copy and paste the visualization name, and describe a summary.

## Key Findings

Based on our analysis of the synthetic campaign data:

*   **Channel Effectiveness:** [Compare the overall effectiveness of email and social media campaigns in terms of conversions or other relevant metrics.]
*   **Cost Efficiency:** [Compare the cost-effectiveness of email and social media campaigns (e.g., cost per conversion). Which channel provides better ROI?]
*   **Synergies:** [Describe any observed synergies between email and social media. For example, do users who interact with both types of campaigns have higher conversion rates?]
*   **Segmentation Insights:** [Summarize how campaign performance varies across different customer segments (e.g., Loyal, Potential, New, Lost).]

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some actionable recommendations:

*   **Optimize Channel Allocation:** [Suggest reallocating budget or effort towards the most effective channel(s).]
*   **Improve Targeting:** [Recommend ways to improve campaign targeting based on customer segmentation insights.]
*   **Content Strategies:** [Suggest strategies for optimizing content and messaging based on what resonates best with the target audience on each channel.]
*   **Leverage Synergies:** [Recommend ways to leverage synergies between email and social media to create a more integrated and effective marketing strategy.]

## Limitations

*   The data used in this project is synthetic. Real-world data may have different characteristics.
*   The analysis is based on a limited set of features. Other factors may influence campaign performance (e.g., seasonality, competitor activity).
*   The SQL queries are designed to work with a tool that can query flat files. The specific syntax may need to be adjusted depending on the tool you're using.
*   SQL Power BI Visualizations is a future goal, and requires it's own file.

## Future Work

*   Analyze real-world campaign data from a marketing platform (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Mailchimp).
*   Incorporate additional features into the analysis (e.g., ad creative attributes, landing page performance).
*   Develop a model to predict campaign performance based on various factors.
*   Implement A/B testing to optimize campaign elements.
